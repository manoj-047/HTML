        I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
        I want you back, I want you back
        My neighbors think I'm crazy, but they don't understand
        You're all I had, you're all I had

        At night, when the stars light up my room
        I sit by myself

        Talking to the moon
        Tryna get to you
        In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
        Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
        Oh

        I'm feelin' like I'm famous, the talk of the town
        They say I've gone mad, yeah, I've gone mad
        But they don't know what I know, 'cause when the sun goes down
        Someone's talking back, yeah, they're talking back, oh

        At night, when the stars light up my room
        I sit by myself

        Talking to the moon
        Tryna get to you
        In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
        Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?

        Ah, ah, ah
        Do you ever hear me calling?
        (Ah) oh-oh-oh (ah), oh-oh-oh (ah)

        'Cause every night I'm talking to the moon
        Still tryna get to you
        In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
        Or am I a fool who sits alone talking to the moon?
        Oh

        I know you're somewhere out there, somewhere far away
